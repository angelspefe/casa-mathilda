who-is-mathilda: >-
  Casa Mathilda is a personal Project that start in my passion for travelling.
  Meeting people and other cultures has always been something very interesting
  for me. In an almost unconscious way, you can perceive the imprint that
  Mathilda has left on me throughout my life: the way she puts the heart in
  every single thing she does, her wisdom of making everyone happy and her
  infinite generosity. This is our spirit when welcoming our guests, sharing and personalizing in
  everyone’s interest, to make their experience unique, and wishing them to feel
  as comfortable as at their home, as comfortable as in Mathilda’s home.
